    The "Number Baseball" game is where the user tries to guess the randomly generated three-digit number by the computer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Generating the Computer's Secret Number:</strong> The computer randomly generates a three-digit number, which becomes the secret answer for the game. For example, let's say the computer generates "789."
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>User's Guess:</strong> The user starts by making a guess of a three-digit number, attempting to figure out the computer's secret number. For instance, the user might guess "123."
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Feedback:</strong> After each guess, the computer provides feedback about the accuracy of the user's guess. The feedback consists of two components:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strikes:</strong> The number of digits that are correct and in the correct position. For example, if the user guessed "123" and the correct answer is "789," there are no strikes.</li>
        <li><strong>Balls:</strong> The number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position. In the same example, there would be no balls.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Adjusting the Guess:</strong> Based on the feedback, the user refines their next guess to improve accuracy. This process continues until the user accurately guesses the computer's randomly generated three-digit number.
    <br>
    <br>
    The game continues, with the user adjusting their guesses using the feedback until they successfully identify the computer's secret three-digit number.
    <br>
    <br>
    I hope this clarifies how the "Number Baseball" game works, with the user attempting to guess the computer's randomly generated number.
